## Installation
Download the 32-bit or 64-bit android apk from [Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/sonictripletrouble16bit/322794) and put it in `ports/sonictt16b`. Do *NOT* rename it! If you run into problems with the 64-bit version, the following steps will "reset" the port:

- Delete `installed.64bit`
- Delete `game.apk` and `game.droid`
